## üìñ Overview

This project presents a robust monitoring system for DC voltage and current, designed and implemented on a **Gowin Tang Nano 9K FPGA**. The system accurately measures analog signals using an **ADS1115 ADC module** and displays the real-time values on an LCD screen.

A key feature of this project is the custom-developed VHDL driver for the I2C communication with the ADS1115, created to overcome compatibility issues with existing libraries on the Tang Nano platform. Furthermore, the design incorporates a critical hardware-based **overvoltage protection circuit** that automatically disconnects the power source to safeguard the system, with a mechanism to safely reconnect upon reset.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously measures and displays voltage and current values.
* **Custom I2C Driver**: A reliable, custom-built VHDL module (`ads_driver`) for interfacing with the ADS1115 ADC, tailored for the Tang Nano 9K.
* **Overvoltage Protection**: A transistor-based circuit automatically disconnects the power source when voltage exceeds a predefined threshold, preventing damage to the system.
* **Safe Reconnection**: The system can be safely reconnected to the power source via a reset pulse after an overvoltage event.
* **LCD Interface**: Displays real-time measurements and system status indicators for user-friendly feedback.
* **Hardware Protection**: A resistive voltage divider scales the input voltage to a safe level for the ADC and FPGA.

## üìÇ VHDL Modules & Project Structure

The project is structured around several VHDL modules, with the core logic residing in the FPGA. The main components are:

* `ads_driver.vhd`: The heart of the ADC interface. This module manages the I2C communication protocol to configure the ADS1115 and read conversion data.
* `i2c_master.vhd`: A generic I2C master component utilized by the `ads_driver`.
* `lcd_controller.vhd`: A module to handle the display logic for the LCD screen.
* `top_level.vhd`: The main entity that integrates all sub-modules and defines the top-level pinout for the Tang Nano 9K.

## üöÄ Setup and Implementation

### 1. Hardware Setup
* Connect the ADS1115 module to the Tang Nano 9K, ensuring the `SCL`, `SDA`, `VCC`, and `GND` pins are correctly wired to the FPGA's I/O pins.
* Connect the LCD screen to the designated GPIO pins on the FPGA.
* Assemble the overvoltage protection circuit and place it between the power source and the system's power input.
* Connect the voltage divider to the input channel of the ADS1115.

### 2. FPGA Programming
* Open the project in Gowin EDA.
* Synthesize the VHDL code and ensure there are no errors.
* Use the Gowin Programmer tool to flash the generated `.fs` bitstream file onto the Tang Nano 9K.

### 3. Operation
* Power on the system. The LCD should initialize and begin displaying voltage and current readings.
* If an overvoltage event occurs, the protection circuit will trip, and the system will power down. An indicator on the LCD may show an "OVERVOLTAGE" status.
* To restore operation, disconnect the faulty power source and press the reset button on the board.

This project serves as a practical example of integrating analog sensors with an FPGA and implementing robust hardware protection mechanisms.
